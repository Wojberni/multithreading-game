## FAQ

## Installation

You must have gcc build-essential and ncurses library installed. You must run it on Linux, because I used POSIX semaphores, which are specific for Unix.

```bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install build-essential libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev
```

## Run program

Now you have to use Makefile to compile and run the client and the server. 

```bash
  make all
  cd objs
  ./server 
  ./client
```

And after quiting the server just delete the directory with the compiled programs.

```bash
  make clean
```
